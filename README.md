# Snake Game

An object-oriented approach to recreate the famous Snake Game

## How to use it:

Use the arrow keys to catch the prey. Avoid running into the walls or your own snake tail. 
Watch the snake grow and crack the high score!


### Possible further improvements:
- Include a second variant which lets the user run through the walls. Let him choose between both options.
